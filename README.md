# Project Title

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

"Stylecheck" will be a tool to analyze the writing style of a text. It can be used to identify the true author of a text by comparing many different parameters: Sentence length, sentence structure, word choice, word repetition, spelling and much more. It is therefore suitable for linguists working historically as well as for forensic scientists.

## Background

The concern that "Stylecheck" focuses on is arguably a niche one. In this clearly defined area, however, where the tool could find application, its advantages would be clear:
- The effort of laboriously comparing texts by hand would henceforth be done by a machine
- Human error and subjectivity would be replaced by fact-based rationality

## How is it used?

Imagine someone on the Internet announcing an assassination with a manifesto. The announced crime scene is cordoned off as a security precaution, and the crime does not take place. Several suspects come into question, all of whom deny the accusations. "Stylecheck" could now compare earlier writings of the suspects with the manifesto to calculate which of them is most likely the author. Particularly striking parallels could even be used as circumstantial evidence in the interrogation.

In a very similar way, researchers could try to assign historical documents to their true author. Is a war report genuine or is it a forgery? Who wrote this play? And differently: did this person really write this play or did he have a ghostwriter?

All questions involving the authorship of a piece of writing could be reanalyzed with the help of computer technology.

## Data sources and AI methods

The data set depends on the topic you want to analyze. If you are interested in the writing style of a famous author, you should analyze his books (it would be best to buy his e-books) or - if he is long dead - you could use an online library as input.
As far as "Stylecheck" is used in investigative procedures, the data set will include everything you can get your hands on - the data base will be quite small anyway, because for understandable reasons criminals always try to leave as few traces as possible.

## Challenges

As already mentioned, "Stylecheck"  will work less reliably if the data basis is too small. Furthermore, it provides probabilities at best - it cannot guarantee its results.

## What next?

As a future projetc you could image to turn the spit and evolute "stylecheck" to "stylecopy": A Tool which can imitate ones wirting style so convincing that even "stylecheck" wouldn't be able to make a difference. It could be fun if you use it to write a drama in the of Shaakespeare, but it also could be dangerous it you use it to generate fake threatening letters, diaries or e-mails.
